# Visual Studio 2019

What's blocking your upgrade to Visual Studio 2019? 

* Extensions: **Log an issue** for extensions that are not available yet in 2019, and that you wish to see. Goal is to keep track here when they are available and whether the author was asked to update it.
* Other things, e.g. an SDK or tool that depends on Visual Studio? Let me know if there is other stuff that's lacking.

# Current status

See open issues.

# What does not belong here:

* Visual Studio issue reports: Use *Visual Studio menu > Help > Report a problem* instead.
* Visual Studio enhancement suggestions:  Use *Visual Studio menu > Help > Suggest a feature* instead.

# A note to extension authors

## Update to Visual Studio 2019 (version 16.0)
This [article](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/how-to-upgrade-extensions-to-support-visual-studio-2019/) describes how to modify the .vsixmanifest to add Visual Studio 2019 support.

## Update to Visual Studio 2019 (version 16.1 preview)

> Synchronously auto-loaded package would be unsupported in a future version of Visual Studio. That version is 16.1.
